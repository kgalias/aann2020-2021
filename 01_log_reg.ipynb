    "## Binomial logistic regression\n",
    "(Binomial) logistic regression is supervised classification method, i.e. we are presented with a dataset $\\{(\\mathbf{x}^i, y^i) : i=1\\ldots N\\}$, where $\\mathbf{x}^i=[x^i_1\\ldots x^i_D]$ is a vector of features, $y^i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is a discrete outcome label, $N$ is the number of examples, and we want to predict $y^i$ from $\\mathbf{x}^i$ (e.g. we want to predict whether someone has cancer based on several test results). Let $p$ denote the probability that a given example has $y=1$. \n",

Exponentiating both sides of the above equation, we get $$\\frac{p}{1-p} = e^{\\mathscr{l}}.$$ From this we can recover $p$ as $$p=\\frac{e^\\mathscr{l}}{1+e^\\mathscr{l}} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\mathscr{l}}}.$$ $\\sigma(t)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-t}}$ is the so-called *logistic function*.
