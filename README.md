# Advanced applications of neural networks (deep learning) @ CogSci UW 2020/2021

## Basics
The class takes place on Mondays at 12:00 (group 1) and 13:45 (group 2) on Google Meet (the link is sent out before each class). For class we use Jupyter Notebook, which can be run on Google Colab.

## Attendance
Attendance is not mandatory (and due to the online nature of the course will not be checked). Doing homework, however, is (more on that below).

## Grading
Your final grade will be based on completing the tasks in the notebooks (50%) and a final project (50%). The final grade percentages are as follows:
- 0-49%: 2
- 50-59%: 3
- 60-69%: 3.5
- 70-79%: 4
- 80-89%: 4.5
- 90-100%: 5

There might also be an opportunity to give a seminar at the end of the semester, which can increase your grade by a small amount (~5%).

### Homework
The solved notebooks have to be handed in (either via email or sharing the file via Google Drive with a notification) until the start of the next class.

### Project
The project will be graded based on compliance with the chosen topic, quality of the code, novelty of the idea, and presentation of the results. Details (along with proposed project topics) will be announced in a separate document.
A two-page report in PDF format detailing your findings is required. The project will be defended (probably during one of the last classes). You can do the project in groups of two, but then you also need to supply a document outlining the contribution of both members (you will be graded separately).
